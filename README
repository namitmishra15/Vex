This will be the repo for our Vex code. I need you guys to install and set up Git, and then clone this repo so you can work at home.

Learn how to use Git (and revision control in general), it will serve you well into your professional lives (if you plan on making a career our of CS).

Flesh out the utility functions (setDrive, setArmMotors, etc) for now.
